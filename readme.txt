PYQUAN is a tool to analyse and quantify GC/MS data.
It combines AMDIS identification output data with a sophisticated alignment
algorithm. Peak quantification is based on peak fitting (exponentential-gaussian 
hybrid function). Area data can be normalized to TIC or an internal standard.
Every step (alignment, quantification, normalization) produces a series of images
for quality control.
