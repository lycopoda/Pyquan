PYQUAN is a tool to analyse and quantify GC/MS data.
It combines AMDIS identification output data with a sophisticated alignment
algorithm. Peak quantification is based on peak fitting (exponentential-gaussian 
hybrid function). Area data can be normalized to TIC or an internal standard.
Every step (alignment, quantification, normalization) produces a series of images
for quality control.

Copy the pyquan folder to your computer. Run setup.py. Details to setup Python on your computer can be found in the manual in the pyquan folder.
